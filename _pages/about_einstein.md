Hi! Thanks for visiting. I am Srija, a first year Masters student at [AI4Bharat](https://dsai.iitm.ac.in/), [IIT, Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/) where I am advised by [Prof. Mitesh Khapra](http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~miteshk/). Before joining as a Masters student, I worked as a Research Assistant at the lab (AI4Bharat) for a year. I completed by B.Tech in Electronics and Communication Engineering from [IIIT, Delhi] in 2021.

Currently, my research interests align with Text to Speech Synthesis (TTS) and building natural-sounding speech for the 22 official Indian languages. I am also thinking about evaluation methods in Text-to-Speech and improving both objective and human evaluation techniques for TTS. My interest in Speech stems from the Speech Synthesis course taught by [Prof. Pravesh Biyani](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/praveshb) at IIIT Delhi, back in 2020.

Previously, I was a software engineer at [Microsoft where I worked on Data Protecion Manager](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/system-center/dpm/dpm-overview?view=sc-dpm-2022).
